# 🎵 Fourier Series Visual Synthesizer

A creative math-visualization tool that uses **Fourier series** to decompose drawn curves into rotating vectors (epicycles), animating their reconstruction in real time.

Built with **p5.js**, this project lets you draw any closed shape and then watch how it can be recreated with a series of sine and cosine waves — a vivid demonstration of the power of Fourier transforms.

An additional feature I added was sound output based on amplitude and frequency.
