# 🎵 Fourier Series Visual Synthesizer

A creative math-visualization tool that uses **Fourier series** to decompose drawn curves into rotating vectors (epicycles), animating their reconstruction in real time.

Built with **p5.js**, this project lets you draw any closed shape and then watch how it can be recreated with a series of sine and cosine waves — a vivid demonstration of the power of Fourier transforms.

## ✨ Features

- 🖌️ Draw a custom shape with your mouse
- 🧮 Real-time **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**
- 🔁 Animated epicycles visualizing each term in the Fourier series
- 📈 Trace output of the approximation over time
- 🧠 Optional extension: Play corresponding synthesized audio using harmonics!
